# Working_With_APIs
API means Application Programming Interface. Here's a code on working with APIs via Django rest framework.
 

We’ll be creating the beginnings of a URL shortener service.

 
Create a new application using the django startapp command. The app should be called links.

Add the links and rest_framework app to INSTALLED_APPS.

 

Create a new file, utils.py in your links app folder. Replace the content of links/utils.py with this starter file https://github.com/TobeTek/Zuri/blob/main/starter-files/Working%20With%20APIs/utils.py . 


 

In links/models.py , create a new model Link. It should have the following attributes:

 Link

--------

target_url : A url path of maxlength 200, use Django’s models.URLField

 

description : A string of maxlength 200, use Django’s models.CharField

 

identifier: A string of maxlength 20, use Django’s models.SlugField. Set blank=True and unique=True for the field.

 

author : A Foreign Key to the current user model. Make use of Django’s get_user_model function.

 

created_date : A date-time column, use Django’s models.DateTimeField.

 

active :  A boolean (True or False), determining if the shortened URL is publicly accessible. Make use of Django’s BooleanField. The default should be True.

 

Now for the serializers. 

Create a new file seriazliers.py in the links app. It will hold all the logic for our serializers.
Create a new serializer, LinkSerializer, which inherits DRF’s serializers.ModelSerializer

 

On to the views. We will only allow users to interact with active/public urls through our API.


In blog/views.py,  create a new view/class PostListApi, which inherits DRF’s generic ListAPIView

 

Create another view, PostCreateApi, which inherits DRF’s generic CreateAPIView
 

Create another view, PostDetailApi which inherits DRF’s generic RetrieveAPIView

 

Create another view PostUpdateApi, which inherits DRF’s generic UpdateAPIView


 

Create another view PostDeleteApi, which inherits django’s generic DestroyAPIView

 

Create a file, links/urls.py, if it doesn’t already exist.

Replace the content of links/urls.py with the content of https://github.com/TobeTek/Zuri/blob/main/starter-files/Working%20With%20APIs/urls.py 

 

Go to your project_app/urls.py and add a new url pattern with the following content:

path("api/links/", include("links.urls"))


Note: This is for beginner.
Enjoy!
